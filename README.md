# COVID-19 Map Application with React Native
## Initial Goals
Build a native mobile application that displays:
* COVID-19 cases per country on a MAP
* COVID-19 cases per country Live on a MAP (changes)
* COVID-19 cases per country based on a date.
* Summary of total cases for the world
* Live Summary for the World
## Strech Goals
* Display data per Province
* User can put their address and track COVID-19 in their neighborhood (Only in countries where regional data is provided)
## Application Milestones
### Step 1
* Set up the React Native environment on your machine
### Step 2
* Go through React Native Tutorials:
  * Build Hello World Applications
  * Run Hello World applications on emulator and your phone.
### Step 3
* Develop a use case to display a map
### Step 4 
* Use a different branch to play around with the COVID-19 API that provides the data.
* Display the data as Text on our application.
### Step 5
* Overlay the data on the maps.

 ```
* Get a Google API Maps key and put it inside the build grade
 ```
 <application>
   <!-- You will only need to add this meta-data tag, but make sure it's a child of application -->
   <meta-data
     android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
     android:value="Your Google maps API Key Here"/>
  
   <!-- You will also only need to add this uses-libray tag -->
   <uses-library android:name="org.apache.http.legacy" android:required="false"/>
